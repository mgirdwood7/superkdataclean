## Data README

No data hosted on github to comply with ethics approval. The code requires a data file exported from redcap - export everything from redcap (don't make any selections). Then use the csv file as the input.

Only files here are

superkneedata notes - this is a variable renaming file
sa1_abs_codes - publicly available codes from ABS for socioeconomic data
